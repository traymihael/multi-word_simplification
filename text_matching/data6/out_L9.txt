Alexandra was naturally shy largely because of her genes , but genes are not switches that say `` shy '' or `` outgoing , '' or `` happy '' or `` sad . ''


Genes are simply chemicals that direct the combination of more chemicals .
	notfound


The chemical that makes up genes is called deoxyribonucleic acid , or DNA .
	notfound


It comprises simple building blocks called bases , of which there are just four different varieties : A , G , C , and T .
	notfound


The bases come together in long strings , and each DNA molecule consists of two of these strings paired according to the rule that A matches T and G matches C. DNA stores information in the order of bases .

The DNA sequence `` AGCT '' means one thing , and the sequence `` TCGA '' something else , as different in meaning as `` taps '' and `` spat . ''
	notfound


The information in DNA is converted into proteins , which are made of amino acids .

Proteins are where the action is .
	notfound


The most important function of proteins is to act as enzymes that change one chemical into another .
	notfound


For example , it 's an enzyme that converts tyrosine , an amino acid found in many foods , into dopamine , a brain chemical that can make you feel active and excited .
	notfound


A different enzyme breaks down the dopamine into smaller molecules and thereby leaves you feeling more relaxed or even lazy .
	notfound


Different enzymes make and degrade the more than 300 brain chemicals that influence thinking , acting , and feeling .
	notfound


The brain and body are built by DNA , and everyone 's DNA is pretty much the same .


We all have 99.9 percent the same DNA as Michael Jordan , Albert Einstein , Elizabeth Taylor , Charles Manson , Julius Caesar , Julia Child , and Jules Verne .
	notfound


All of them and everyone who has ever lived have the same 100,000 or so genes , which are organized into the same 23 chromosomes .
	notfound


But `` pretty much the same '' is not exactly the same .


There are differences in DNA?about 0.1 percent , or 1 bit out of every 1,000 .


Considering that there are 3 billion chemical bases in question , the differences matter .
	notfound


Where Michael Jordan 's DNA says `` G , '' Michael Jackson 's may say `` C , '' and Andrew Jackson 's said `` T , '' while Jack the Ripper 's said `` A. '' There are roughly 3 million such differences between individuals , and these differences are responsible for all the inherited aspects of the variations among people , from eye color to height to personality or intelligence .
	notfound


It 's hard to believe that such a tiny difference?onetenth of 1 percent?could make such a great difference in how people turn out , yet this percentage is actually an exaggeration .
	notfound


Many of the 3 million variations do n't mean anything as far as we know , so there are even fewer differences that matter .
	notfound


If you still do n't believe that 0.1 percent of DNA could be responsible for so many differences , consider the fact that human DNA differs from chimpanzee DNA by only 1 to 2 percent ; your DNA and a chimp 's are at least 98 percent the same .

Yet this seemingly `` fine print '' of DNA instructions is the reason humans can do calculus , compose poetry , and build cathedrals , while chimps pick bugs off each other and eat them .
	notfound


Humans have pretty much the same DNA as a chimp because that 's where we came from ; and the chimp is close to the ape because that 's where he came from ; and so on down the line to fish and reptiles and even single-cell organisms such as yeast .
	notfound


This evolutionary conservation has a beneficial side effect : we can often figure out what a human gene does by looking at a similar gene in simpler organisms .
	notfound


One of the most common misconceptions about genetics is that there are genes `` for '' things .
	notfound


Some people have the genes `` for '' breast cancer , shyness , blue eyes , and so they must have the disease , condition , or trait .
	notfound


This is what people tend to think when they hear about a gene `` for '' depression , or a `` gay gene , '' or `` obesity gene . ''
	notfound


If that were true , it would be easy enough to undergo testing to see what genes you have , and therefore what you ought to worry about .

That 's not the way it works .


Everyone has a `` mood gene , '' and a `` sexual orientation gene , '' and a gene that regulates body weight .
	c:	sexual orientation	[adj noun]	C1


The difference is that the genes come in different varieties or flavors .


For example , maybe the `` mood gene , '' which everyone has , makes a receptor protein that responds to the hormones released under stress .


Maybe the only difference between two people is that one has a gene with T at position 4,356 , whereas the other person has a C at the same spot .
	notfound


That might be enough to affect the strength of the electrical current flowing through the cells , so the same amount of hormone produces a gentle buzz in one person and a walloping jolt in another .
	notfound


That single detail ?
	notfound


1 letter out of 3 billion?could mean the difference between a mostly cheerful person and one who is easily depressed .


Both people have the same gene , but the fine print makes all the difference .
	notfound


Imagine a room filled with 30,000 books .
	notfound


Here the difference would be the equivalent of a single letter in a single book .
