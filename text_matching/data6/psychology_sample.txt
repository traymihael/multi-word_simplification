The root ology denotes scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind .


Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior .
	notfound


The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge .
	notfound


To apply the scientific method , a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation , called a hypothesis , to explain the phenomenon .
	notfound


A hypothesis is not just any explanation ; it should fit into the context of a scientific theory .
	notfound


A scientific theory is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time .
	notfound


A theory is the best understanding that we have of that part of the natural world .


Armed with the hypothesis , the researcher then makes observations or , better still , carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis .
	notfound


That test and its results are then published so that others can check the results or build on them .


It is necessary that any explanation in science be testable , which means that the phenomenon must be perceivable and measurable .
	notfound


For example , that a bird sings because it is happy is not a testable hypothesis , since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird .
	notfound


We must ask a different question , perhaps about the brain state of the bird , since this can be measured .
	notfound


In general , science deals only with matter and energy , that is , those things that can be measured , and it can not arrive at knowledge about values and morality .
	notfound


This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited , since thoughts , at least as we experience them , are neither matter nor energy .

The scientific method is also a form of empiricism .
	notfound


An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation , including experimentation , rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities .


It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline .
	notfound


Before this time , the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy .


Given that any behavior is , at its roots , biological , some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology .
	notfound


No biological organism exists in isolation , and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others .
	c:	be influence	[verb verb]	B2


Therefore , psychology is also a social science .

	notfound


Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of their undergraduate coursework -LRB- American Psychological Association , 2011 -RRB- .
	notfound


Together , these factors increase students ' scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they encounter .
	notfound


In addition to these broad-based skills , psychology students come to understand the complex factors that shape one 's behavior .
	notfound


They appreciate the interaction of our biology , our environment , and our experiences in determining who we are and how we will behave .
	notfound


They learn about basic principles that guide how we think and behave , and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across cultural boundaries -LRB- American Psychological Association , 2011 -RRB- .
	notfound


Summary Psychology derives from the roots psyche -LRB- meaning soul -RRB- and - ology -LRB- meaning scientific study of -RRB- .


Thus , psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior .


Students of psychology develop critical thinking skills , become familiar with the scientific method , and recognize the complexity of behavior .
