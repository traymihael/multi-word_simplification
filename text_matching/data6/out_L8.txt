I do n't think any segregation law angered black people in Montgomery more than bus segregation .
	notfound


And that had been so since the laws about segregation on public transportation had been passed .
	notfound


That was back in 1900 , and black people had boycotted Montgomery streetcars until the City Council changed its ordinance so that nobody would be forced to give up a seat unless there was another seat to move to .

But over the years practices had changed , although the law had not .


When I was put off the bus back in 1943 , the bus driver was really acting against the law .
	notfound


In 1945 , two years after that incident , the State of Alabama passed a law requiring that all bus companies under its jurisdiction enforce segregation .


But that law did not spell out what bus drivers were supposed to do in a case like mine .
	notfound


Here it was , half a century after the first segregation law , and there were 50,000 African Americans in Montgomery .
	notfound


More of us rode the buses than Caucasians did , because more whites could afford cars .
	notfound


It was very humiliating having to suffer the indignity of riding segregated buses twice a day , five days a week , to go downtown and work for white people .


When I got off from work that evening of December 1 , I went to Court Square as usual to catch the Cleveland Avenue bus home .


I did n't look to see who was driving when I got on , and by the time I recognized him , I had already paid my fare .
	notfound


It was the same driver who had put me off the bus back in 1943 , twelve years earlier .
	notfound


He was still tall and heavy , with red , rough-looking skin .
	notfound


And he was still mean-looking .
	notfound


I did n't know if he had been on that route before?they switched the drivers around sometimes .
	notfound


I do know that most of the time if I saw him on a bus , I would n't get on it .


I saw a vacant seat in the middle section of the bus and took it .


I did n't even question why there was a vacant seat even though there were quite a few people standing in the back .
	notfound


If I had thought about it at all , I would probably have figured maybe someone saw me get on and did not take the seat but left it vacant for me .


There was a man sitting next to the window and two women across the aisle .

The next stop was the Empire Theater , and some whites got on .


They filled up the white seats , and one man was left standing .
	notfound


The driver looked back and noticed the man standing .


Then he looked back at us .


He said , `` Let me have those front seats , '' because they were the front seats of the black section .
	notfound


Did n't anybody move .
	notfound


We just sat right where we were , the four of us .
	notfound


Then he spoke a second time : `` Y' all better make it light on yourselves and let me have those seats . ''
	notfound


The man in the window seat next to me stood up , and I moved to let him pass by me , and then I looked across the aisle and saw that the two women were also standing .

I moved over to the window seat .


I could not see how standing up was going to `` make it light '' for me .
	notfound


The more we gave in and complied , the worse they treated us .
	notfound


I thought back to the time when I used to sit up all night and did n't sleep , and my grandfather would have his gun right by the fireplace , or if he had his onehorse wagon going anywhere , he always had his gun in the back of the wagon .
	notfound


People always say that I did n't give up my seat because I was tired , but that is n't true .
	notfound


I was not tired physically , or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day .


I was not old , although some people have an image of me as being old then .


I was forty-two .
	notfound


No , the only tired I was , was tired of giving in .


The driver of the bus saw me still sitting there , and he asked was I going to stand up .


I said , `` No . ''
	notfound


He said , `` Well , I 'm going to have you arrested . ''
	notfound


Then I said , `` You may do that . ''
	notfound


These were the only words we said to each other .


I did n't even know his name , which was James Blake , until we were in court together .
	notfound


He got out of the bus and stayed outside for a few minutes , waiting for the police .


As I sat there , I tried not to think about what might happen .
	notfound


I knew that anything was possible .
	notfound


I could be manhandled or beaten .


I could be arrested .


People have asked me if it occurred to me then that I could be the test case the NAACP had been looking for .
	notfound


I did not think about that at all .


In fact if I had let myself think too deeply about what might happen to me , I might have gotten off the bus .
	notfound


But I chose to remain .
	notfound


Meanwhile there were people getting off the bus and asking for transfers , so that began to loosen up the crowd , especially in the back of the bus .
	c:	loosen up	[verb prep]	C2


Not everyone got off , but everybody was very quiet .
	notfound


What conversation there was , was in low tones ; no one was talking out loud .
	notfound


It would have been quite interesting to have seen the whole bus empty out .
	notfound


Or if the other three had stayed where they were , because if they 'd had to arrest four of us instead of one , then that would have given me a little support .
	notfound


But it did n't matter .


I never thought hard of them at all and never even bothered to criticize them .
	notfound


Eventually two policemen came .
	notfound


They got on the bus , and one of them asked me why I did n't stand up .


I asked him , `` Why do you all push us around ? ''
	notfound


He said to me , and I quote him exactly , `` I do n't know , but the law is the law and you 're under arrest . ''
