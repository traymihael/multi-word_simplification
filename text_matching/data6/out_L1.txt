One of the most provocative viral YouTube videos in the past two years begins mundanely enough : a one-year-old girl plays with an iPad , sweeping her fingers across its touch screen and shuffling groups of icons .

In following scenes , she appears to pinch , swipe , and prod the pages of paper magazines as though they , too , are screens .
	notfound


Melodramatically , the video replays these gestures in close-up .
	notfound


For the girl 's father , the video?A Magazine Is an iPad That Does Not Work?is evidence of a generational transition .
	notfound


In an accompanying description , he writes , `` Magazines are now useless and impossible to understand , for digital natives '' ?
	notfound


that is , for people who have been interacting with digital technologies from a very early age , surrounded not only by paper books and magazines but also by smartphones , Kindles , and iPads .
	notfound


Whether or not his daughter truly expected the magazines to behave like an iPad , the video brings into focus a question that is relevant to far more than the youngest among us : How exactly does the technology we use to read change the way we read ?

Before 1992 most experiments concluded that people read stories and articles on screens more slowly and remember less about them .
	notfound


As the resolution of screens on all kinds of devices sharpened , however , a more mixed set of findings began to emerge .

Recent surveys suggest that although most people still prefer paper ?

especially when they need to concentrate for a long time?attitudes are changing as tablets and e-reading technology improve and as reading digital texts for facts and fun becomes more common .

In the United States , e-books currently make up more than 20 percent of all books sold to the general public .

Despite all the increasingly user-friendly and popular technology , most studies published since the early 1990s confirm earlier conclusions : paper still has advantages over screens as a reading medium .
	notfound


Together , laboratory experiments , polls , and consumer reports indicate that digital devices prevent people from efficiently navigating long texts , which may subtly inhibit reading comprehension .
	notfound


Compared with paper , screens may also drain more of our mental resources while we are reading and make it a little harder to remember what we read when we are done .

Whether they realize it or not , people often approach computers and tablets with a state of mind less conducive to learning than the one they bring to paper .

And e-readers fail to re-create certain tactile experiences of reading on paper , the absence of which some find unsettling .
	notfound


Understanding how reading on paper differs from reading on screens requires some explanation of how the human brain interprets written language .


Although letters and words are symbols representing sounds and ideas , the brain also regards them as physical objects .
	notfound


As Maryanne Wolf of Tufts University explains in her 2007 book Proust and the Squid , we are not born with brain circuits dedicated to reading , because we did not invent writing until relatively recently in our evolutionary history , around the fourth millennium B.C. .
	notfound


So in childhood the brain improvises a brand-new circuit for reading by weaving together various ribbons of neural tissue devoted to other abilities , such as speaking , motor coordination , and vision .

Some of these repurposed brain regions specialize in object recognition : they help us instantly distinguish an apple from an orange , for example , based on their distinct features , yet classify both as fruit .
	notfound


Similarly , when we learn to read and write , we begin to recognize letters by their particular arrangements of lines , curves , and hollow spaces?a tactile learning process that requires both our eyes and our hands .
	notfound


In recent research by Karin James of Indiana University Bloomington , the reading circuits of five-year-old children crackled with activity when they practiced writing letters by hand but not when they typed letters on a keyboard .
	notfound


And when people read cursive writing or intricate characters such as Japanese kanji , the brain literally goes through the motions of writing , even if the hands are empty .

Beyond treating individual letters as physical objects , the human brain may also perceive a text in its entirety as a kind of physical landscape .

When we read , we construct a mental representation of the text .
	notfound


The exact nature of such representations remains unclear , but some researchers think they are similar to the mental maps we create of terrain?such as mountains and trails?and of indoor physical spaces , such as apartments and offices .

Both anecdotally and in published studies , people report that when trying to locate a particular passage in a book , they often remember where in the text it appeared .

Much as we might recall that we passed the red farmhouse near the start of a hiking trail before we started climbing uphill through the forest , we remember that we read about Mr. Darcy rebuffing Elizabeth Bennet at a dance on the bottom left corner of the left-hand page in one of the earlier chapters of Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice .

In most cases , paper books have more obvious topography than on-screen text .
	notfound


An open paper book presents a reader with two clearly defined domains?the left - and right-hand pages?and a total of eight corners with which to orient oneself .
	notfound


You can focus on a single page of a paper book without losing awareness of the whole text .


You can even feel the thickness of the pages you have read in one hand and the pages you have yet to read in the other .
	notfound


Turning the pages of a paper book is like leaving one footprint after another on a trail?there is a rhythm to it and a visible record of how far one has traveled .


All these features not only make the text in a paper book easily navigable , they also make it easier to form a coherent mental map of that text .
	notfound


In contrast , most digital devices interfere with intuitive navigation of a text and inhibit people from mapping the journey in their mind .

A reader of digital text might scroll through a seamless stream of words , tap forward one page at a time , or use the search function to immediately locate a particular phrase?but it is difficult to see any one passage in the context of the entire text .

As an analogy , imagine if Google Maps allowed people to navigate street by individual street , as well as teleport to any specific address , but prevented them from zooming out to see a neighborhood , state , or country .
	notfound


Likewise , glancing at a progress bar gives a far more vague sense of place than feeling the weight of read and unread pages .
	notfound


And although e-readers and tablets replicate pagination , the displayed pages are ephemeral .
	notfound


Once read , those pages vanish .
	notfound


Instead of hiking the trail yourself , you watch the trees , rocks , and moss pass by in flashes , with no tangible trace of what came before and no easy way to see what lies ahead .
