Metaphor is for most people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish?a matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language .


Moreover , metaphor is typically viewed as characteristic of language alone , a matter of words rather than thought or action .


For this reason , most people think they can get along perfectly well without metaphor .
	notfound


We have found , on the contrary , that metaphor is pervasive in everyday life , not just in language but in thought and action .
	notfound


Our ordinary conceptual system , in terms of which we both think and act , is fundamentally metaphorical in nature .
	notfound


The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect .
	notfound


They also govern our everyday functioning , down to the most mundane details .


Our concepts structure what we perceive , how we get around in the world , and how we relate to other people .
	notfound


Our conceptual system thus plays a central role in defining our everyday realities .
	notfound


If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical , then the way we think , what we experience , and what we do every day is very much a matter of metaphor .
	notfound


But our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of .
	notfound


In most of the little things we do every day , we simply think and act more or less automatically along certain lines .
	notfound


Just what these lines are is by no means obvious .

One way to find out is by looking at language .
	notfound


Since communication is based on the same conceptual system that we use in thinking and acting , language is an important source of evidence for what that system is like .
	notfound


Primarily on the basis of linguistic evidence , we have found that most of our ordinary conceptual system is metaphorical in nature .
	notfound


And we have found a way to begin to identify in detail just what the metaphors are that structure how we perceive , how we think , and what we do .
	notfound


To give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such a concept to structure an everyday activity , let us start with the concept ARGUMENT and the conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR .
	notfound


This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety of expressions : ARGUMENT IS WAR Your claims are indefensible .
	notfound


He attacked every weak point in my argument .


His criticisms were right on target .


I demolished his argument .
	notfound


I 've never won an argument with him .
	notfound


You disagree ?
	notfound


Okay , shoot !
	notfound


If you use that strategy , he 'll wipe you out .
	notfound


He shot down all of my arguments .


It is important to see that we do n't just talk about arguments in terms of war .
	notfound


We can actually win or lose arguments .
	notfound


We see the person we are arguing with as an opponent .
	notfound


We attack his positions and we defend our own .
	notfound


We gain and lose ground .


We plan and use strategies .
	notfound


If we find a position indefensible , we can abandon it and take a new line of attack .
	notfound


Many of the things we do in arguing are partially structured by the concept of war .
	notfound


Though there is no physical battle , there is a verbal battle , and the structure of an argument?attack , defense , counterattack , etc. ?
	notfound


reflects this .
	notfound


It is in this sense that the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor is one that we live by in this culture ; it structures the actions we perform in arguing .
	notfound


Try to imagine a culture where arguments are not viewed in terms of war , where no one wins or loses , where there is no sense of attacking or defending , gaining or losing ground .
	notfound


Imagine a culture where an argument is viewed as a dance , the participants are seen as performers , and the goal is to perform in a balanced and aesthetically pleasing way .
	c:	aesthetically please	[adv verb]	unknown


In such a culture , people would view arguments differently , experience them differently , carry them out differently , and talk about them differently .


But we would probably not view them as arguing at all : they would simply be doing something different .
	notfound


It would seem strange even to call what they were doing `` arguing . ''
	notfound


Perhaps the most neutral way of describing this difference between their culture and ours would be to say that we have a discourse form structured in terms of battle and they have one structured in terms of dance .
	notfound


This is an example of what it means for a metaphorical concept , namely , ARGUMENT IS WAR , to structure -LRB- at least in part -RRB- what we do and how we understand what we are doing when we argue .

The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another .
	notfound


It is not that arguments are a subspecies of war .
	notfound


Arguments and wars are different kinds of things?verbal discourse and armed conflict?and the actions performed are different kinds of actions .
	notfound


But ARGUMENT is partially structured , understood , performed , and talked about in terms of WAR .
	notfound


The concept is metaphorically structured , the activity is metaphorically structured , and , consequently , the language is metaphorically structured .
	notfound


Moreover , this is the ordinary way of having an argument and talking about one .
	notfound


The normal way for us to talk about attacking a position is to use the words '' attack a position . ''
	notfound


Our conventional ways of talking about arguments presuppose a metaphor we are hardly ever conscious of .
	notfound


The metaphor is not merely in the words we use?it is in our very concept of an argument .
	notfound


The language of argument is not poetic , fanciful , or rhetorical ; it is literal .
	notfound


We talk about arguments that way because we conceive of them that way?and we act according to the way we conceive of things .

The most important claim we have made so far is that metaphor is not just a matter of language , that is , of mere words .
	notfound


We shall argue that , on the contrary , human thought processes are largely metaphorical .


This is what we mean when we say that the human conceptual system is metaphorically structured and defined .
	notfound


Metaphors as linguistic expressions are possible precisely because there are metaphors in a person 's conceptual system .
