Future vehicles can be expected to present a good deal of information , especially inside vehicles , using Intelligent Transportation Systems or ITS .
	notfound


Their use reflects the general philosophy that safety problems can be remedied with new technology .
	notfound


Availability of technology , rather than driver information needs , appears to be driving the industry to add many of these features to new vehicles .


However , our understanding of human abilities has not kept up with the rapid advances in vehicle technology .
	notfound


Use of such systems will be a challenge for many older drivers .

Among the ITS that are already available or being developed are : in-vehicle navigation systems that tell a driver 's location , directions to a destination , alternate routes , location of congestion or accidents , when to turn at intersections , names of upcoming streets , and more E adaptive cruise control , where sensors detect the distance to the vehicle ahead and adjust speed so as to create a safe following distance E '' smart signs '' project on the windscreen containing information warning of hazards -LRB- e.g. , railroad crossing -RRB- or regulations -LRB- e.g. , speed limit change -RRB- ; these could replace or supplement existing roadside signs E collision warning systems , which let drivers know when they are closing in too fast on a fixed object or another vehicle -LRB- to prevent rear-end collisions , side swipe , and run-off-road accidents -RRB- E crash avoidance systems that actually take control of the vehicle if a collision is otherwise inevitable E vision enhancement systems -LRB- VES -RRB- that detect hazards such as pedestrians and animals on the road at night , allowing the driver to detect hazards that might otherwise be detected too late or not at all ; other VES include ultraviolet headlights which reflect more light back from special pavement markings and hazards -LRB- bridge abutments -RRB- at night E headlights that shine around curves as vehicles begin to turn , allowing vision farther ahead on curves E information of interest to tourists -LRB- accommodation , fuel , food , and so forth -RRB- which now appears mainly on signs communication devices such as phones , e-mail , and fax machines additional vehicle systems monitoring , some of which may not be necessary -LRB- e.g. , outside temperature -RRB- emergency alerting systems meant to provide to a dispatch center emergency information about breakdowns , accidents , and other events that require assistance -LRB- e.g. , ambulance , tow truck -RRB- ; such alerting devices give an increased sense of security to drivers .

It is also possible in the future to have devices in vehicles which communicate driver actions and condition , vehicle location , speed , and maneuvers to a central processing station for recording .
	notfound


This would be accomplished with sensors and transmitters in vehicles and in or beside the road .


As the workload , both physical and mental , increases in complex systems , designers have introduced automation to reduce the load .
	notfound


This is the case with motor vehicles in which we now see automatic gear shifting , power steering , cruise control , and so on .


With increased automation , and an apparently `` easier '' driving task , comes a shift in the driver 's role from operational to supervisory , raising concerns about inattention and reduced vigilance .
	notfound


Young and Stanton -LRB- 1997 -RRB- suggest that automated systems could reduce driver workload to such an extent that it may be detrimental to driving performance .
	notfound


Humans operate best at an optimal level of arousal , and either too much or too little workload can be detrimental to performance .


One argument is that if vehicle operation becomes too automated -LRB- e.g. , adaptive cruise control , steering which keeps the car in its lane until interrupted -RRB- drivers will reduce attention and gradually lose the ability to control the vehicle when it comes to an emergency in which they must take control .
	notfound


Real-life tasks involve a balance of automatic and controlled processes , and mental load is determined by the proportions of each .


Vehicle speed is an issue in many collisions ; therefore there might be an advantage to having automated speed control .


Among the systems that have been studied to control vehicle speed is the External Vehicle Speed Control -LRB- EVSC -RRB- being tested in the U.K. Intelligent speed adaptation devices detect the vehicle speed and provide feedback to drivers or limit vehicle speed .
	notfound


In the case of an `` advisory '' system the driver is informed of the speed limit and changes in the speed limit -LRB- e.g. , through built-up areas -RRB- .
	c:	built-up area	[adj noun]	unknown


With a `` voluntary '' system the driver is able to disable the system , and in the `` mandatory '' mode the system limits the vehicle speed at all times .
	notfound


In addition , the speed limits can be fixed -LRB- the posted limit -RRB- , variable -LRB- changed based on location , such as reduced near pedestrian crossings -RRB- or dynamic -LRB- e.g. , modified by weather or traffic conditions -RRB- .
	notfound


The best estimates of the accident savings vary from ten percent for a fixed advisory system to 36 percent for a mandatory dynamic system .


Estimates of reduction in fatal accidents are even higher -LRB- 18 to 59 percent , respectively , for the two systems -RRB- .


With the advancement in mobile office technology comes more opportunity for drivers to process information while on the move .


The cognitive demands of a speech-based e-mail system were examined by Jamson et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .
	notfound


In a simulator study , incoming e-mails were either controlled by the system -LRB- the driver was alerted to the arrival of a message which was then presented by a voice system , displayed on an LCD screen in the center of the dashboard -RRB- , or controlled by the driver -LRB- who was alerted but decided when to accept the message -RRB- .

Drivers were required to respond to the messages while driving .


Performance was generally better?reduced time to detect a collision and reduced anticipation to braking demands?when the driver controlled e-mail reception , and drivers were less responsive when processing e-mails .

This showed the `` increased cognitive costs '' associated with the decision making required of the driver .

Speech-based interface was also studied in a car-following task by Lee et al. -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , who measured how a speech-based e-mail system influenced drivers ' response to a lead vehicle which braked periodically .
	notfound


There was a 30 percent increase in reaction time when the speech-based system was used , as compared with a condition where the e-mail system was not used .
	notfound


Traffic density was also manipulated in this simulator study .
	notfound


Subjective workload ratings showed that speech-based interaction led to a significant workload which was highest for the complex e-mail system -LRB- with more menus and more options -RRB- .
	notfound


The more complex driving environment also increased response time , but only when the system was used .
	notfound


Behavioral adaptation is the tendency for drivers to modify their behavior to adjust to new conditions or modifications to the road , environment , or vehicle .
	notfound


Drivers typically slow in poor weather , increase attention in heavy traffic , and so on .
	notfound


But how will they respond to the presence of ITS in vehicles ?


Smiley -LRB- 2000 -RRB- provides a good review of the ITS that may affect driver adaptation behavior .


Drivers who have vehicles with collision warning systems may speed or follow too closely .
	notfound


Adaptive cruise control -LRB- ACC -RRB- may reduce driver workload , leading to less time looking at the road or more time driving in heavy traffic when tired .
	notfound


ACC does not respond to stopped vehicles on the road , one of the most dangerous conditions leading to rear-end collisions .


Fully automated highways , which relieve the driver of the driving task , would seem to be an ideal solution to safety problems .
	notfound


However , a number of human factors issues arise when considering how this would operate .
	c:	human factor	[adj noun]	B2


Drivers may become complacent about the driving task and not be paying attention when it came time to take control upon leaving an automated road , or if there were technical difficulties suddenly requiring them to take control of the vehicle .
	notfound


Many drivers would object to the loss of control , as steering , shifting gears , and accelerating play a major role in the `` joy of driving . ''
