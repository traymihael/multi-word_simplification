Total revenue and total costs for the raspberry farm , broken down into fixed and variable costs , are shown in and also appear in .
	c:	break down	[verb prep]	B1	10,11

At higher levels of output , total cost begins to slope upward more steeply because of diminishing marginal returns .
	c:	because of	[prep prep]	B1	14,15

On , the vertical gap between total revenue and total cost represents either profit -LRB- if total revenues are greater that total costs at a certain quantity -RRB- or losses -LRB- if total costs are greater that total revenues at a certain quantity -RRB- .

They can not be sure of what total costs would look like if they , say , doubled production or cut production in half , because they have not tried it .
	c:	look like	[verb prep]	B1	10,11

The marginal cost -LRB- MC -RRB- curve is sometimes first downward-sloping , if there is a region of increasing marginal returns at low levels of output , but is eventually upward-sloping at higher levels of output as diminishing marginal returns kick in .
	c:	kick in	[verb prep]	C1	40,41

A profit-seeking firm should keep expanding production as long as MR > MC .
	c:	as long as	[adv adv prep]	B1	7,8,9

Remember , however , that the firm has already paid for fixed costs , such as equipment , so it may continue to produce and incur a loss .

The possibility that a firm may earn losses raises a question : Why can the firm not avoid losses by shutting down and not producing at all ?
	c:	at all	[prep det]	B1	25,26

The answer is that shutting down can reduce variable costs to zero , but in the short run , the firm has already paid for fixed costs .

In all three cases , the Yoga Center loses money .
	c:	in all	[prep det]	B2	0,1

In all three cases , when the rental contract expires in the long run , assuming revenues do not improve , the firm should exit this business .
	c:	in all	[prep det]	B2	0,1

In the short run , though , the decision varies depending on the level of losses and whether the firm can cover its variable costs .
	d:	in short	[prep adj]	C1	4,9

In contrast , in scenario 3 the revenue that the center can earn is high enough that the losses diminish when it remains open , so the center should remain open in the short run .
	d:	in short	[prep adj]	C1	4,100

This example suggests that the key factor is whether a firm can earn enough revenues to cover at least its variable costs by remaining open .
	c:	at least	[prep adj]	B2	17,18

If the perfectly competitive firm can charge a price above the shutdown point , then the firm is at least covering its average variable costs .
	c:	at least	[prep adj]	B2	18,19

If price falls in the zone between the shutdown point and the zero-profit point , then the firm is making losses but will continue to operate in the short run , since it is covering its variable costs .
	d:	in short	[prep adj]	C1	14,83

At any price above that level , the firm will earn profits in the short run .
	d:	in short	[prep adj]	C1	37,42

Marginal Cost and the Firm?s Supply CurveFor a perfectly competitive firm , the marginal cost curve is identical to the firm?s supply curve starting from the minimum point on the average variable cost curve .
	d:	on average	[prep adj]	B2	76,81

This rule means that the firm checks the market price , and then looks at its marginal cost to determine the quantity to produce?and makes sure that the price is greater than the minimum average variable cost .
	c:	make sure	[verb adj]	A2	24,25

In other words , the marginal cost curve above the minimum point on the average variable cost curve becomes the firm?s supply curve .
	d:	on average	[prep adj]	B2	35,40

A shift in costs of production that increases marginal costs at all levels of output?and shifts MC to the left?will cause a perfectly competitive firm to produce less at any given market price .

Why is there a minus sign in front of imports ?
	c:	in front	[prep noun]	A2	6,7

When an American buys a foreign product , for example , it gets counted along with all the other consumption .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	8,9

So the income generated does not go to American producers , but rather to producers in another country ; it would be wrong to count this as part of domestic demand .
	c:	be wrong	[verb adj]	A2	21,22

Therefore , imports added in consumption are subtracted back out in the M term of the equation .

	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you , remember that since GDP was about $ 14.4 trillion in 2009 , a seemingly small change of 2 % of GDP is equal to close to $ 300 billion .

With the AD/AS framework in mind , many economists might readily believe that the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 , which took effect just after two serious recessions , were beneficial economic policy .
	c:	take effect	[verb noun]	C1	21,22

However , some of the same economists who favor tax cuts in time of recession would be much more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is performing well and cyclical unemployment is low .

To calculate elasticity , instead of using simple percentage changes in quantity and price , economists use the average percent change in both quantity and price .

Over the long term , exchange rates must bear some relationship to the buying power of the currency in terms of goods that are internationally traded .
	c:	exchange rate	[noun noun]	B1	5,6

For example , if a U.S. dollar is worth $ 1.60 in Canadian currency , then a car that sells for $ 20,000 in the United States should sell for $ 32,000 in Canada .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

If the price of cars in Canada was much lower than $ 32,000 , then at least some U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada .

It is true that if pollution charges are set very low or if marketable permits do not reduce pollution by very much then market-oriented tools will not work well .
	c:	very much	[adv adj]	A1	20,21

The advantage of market-oriented environmental tools is not that they reduce pollution by more or less , but because of their incentives and flexibility , they can achieve any desired reduction in pollution at a lower cost to society .
	c:	because of	[prep prep]	B1	18,19

For example , marketable permits work best when a few dozen or a few hundred parties are highly interested in trading , as in the cases of oil refineries that trade lead permits or electrical utilities that trade sulfur dioxide permits .

The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product?s price , are changing .

If all else is not held equal , then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold , as the following Clear It Up feature shows .
	d:	clear up	[adj prep]	B2	66,73

For example , a consumer?s demand depends on income and a producer?s supply depends on the cost of producing the product .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

For example , we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy -LRB- assuming income , and anything else that affects demand , is unchanged -RRB- .

As a result of the higher income levels , the demand curve shifts to the right to the new demand curve D1 , indicating an increase in demand .
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	26,27

The shift from D0 to D2 represents such a decrease in demand : At any given price level , the quantity demanded is now lower .

In this example , not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone would buy or not buy an additional car .

Income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand .
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	10,11

A change in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given price will cause a shift in demand .
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	26,27

Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste , which change the quantity of a good demanded at every price : that is , they shift the demand curve for that good , rightward for chicken and leftward for beef .

Each of these changes in demand will be shown as a shift in the demand curve .

	c:	because of	[prep prep]	B1	21,22

Since people are purchasing tablets , there has been a decrease in demand for laptops , which can be shown graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops .
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	11,12

Other goods are complements for each other , meaning that the goods are often used together , because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other .

While it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded , it is also true that expectations about the future price -LRB- or expectations about tastes and preferences , income , and so on -RRB- can affect demand .
	c:	and so on	[conj adv prep]	B1	35,36,37

For example , if people hear that a hurricane is coming , they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water .

These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve .
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	2,3

Therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor -LRB- other than price -RRB- causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price .
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	4,5
	c:	other than	[adj prep]	C1	15,16

A shift in demand means that at any price -LRB- and at every price -RRB- , the quantity demanded will be different than it was before .

Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase .
	c:	due to	[adj prep]	B1	9,10
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	7,8

You will see that an increase in income causes an upward -LRB- or rightward -RRB- shift in the demand curve , so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher , as shown in .
	d:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	23,57

The direction of the arrows indicates whether the demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand .
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	14,15

A change in the price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve , and it typically leads to some change in the quantity demanded , but it does not shift the demand curve .
	d:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	12,51

Before discussing how changes in demand can affect equilibrium price and quantity , we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves .
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	4,5

Just as a shift in demand is represented by a change in the quantity demanded at every price , a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price .
	c:	just as	[adv prep]	B1	0,1
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	4,5

If a firm faces lower costs of production , while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged , a firm?s profits go up .
	c:	go up	[verb prep]	C2	26,27

Take , for example , a messenger company that delivers packages around a city .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	2,3

For example , given the lower gasoline prices , the company can now serve a greater area , and increase its supply .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

The shift of supply to the right , from S0 to S2 , means that at all prices , the quantity supplied has increased .
	c:	at all	[prep det]	B1	15,16

Several other things affect the cost of production , too , such as changes in weather or other natural conditions , new technologies for production , and some government policies .
	c:	such as	[adj prep]	A2	11,12

For example , in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China , which produces most of the country 's wheat , corn , and soybeans , experienced its most severe drought in 50 years .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well .
	c:	as well	[adv adv]	A1	27,28

For instance , in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice .

For example , the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $ 8 billion per year from producers .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

What happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up ?
	c:	go up	[verb prep]	C2	11,12

Following is an example of a shift in supply due to a production cost increase .

	c:	in that	[prep det]	B2	21,22

Now , suppose that the cost of production goes up .
	c:	go up	[verb adv]	C2	8,9

In turn , these factors affect how much firms are willing to supply at any given price .
	c:	in turn	[prep noun]	C1	0,1

Factors other than price that affect demand and supply are included by using shifts in the demand or the supply curve .

The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models .
	d:	clear up	[adj prep]	B2	9,17

Note that if more than one variable is changing at the same time , the overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts ; when there are multiple variables , economists isolate each change and analyze it independently .
	c:	at the same time	[prep det adj noun]	B1	9,10,11,12

For example , if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii , but the ticket turns out to be expensive during the week you intend to go , you might consider other weeks when the ticket might be cheaper .

In ancient times , messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms .
	d:	in time	[prep noun]	B1	4,9

Moreover , killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect : Other messengers would refuse to bring news to that city or kingdom , depriving its citizens of vital information .
	c:	side effect	[noun noun]	C1	8,9

Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger?or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that prices are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity .
	c:	at least	[prep adj]	B2	11,12

Changes in demand and supply will continue to reveal themselves through consumers ?
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	1,2

Suppose that as the demand for nurses increases , the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses entering retirement and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees .
	c:	due to	[adj prep]	B1	12,13

The situation of the labor market for nurses described in the beginning of the chapter is different from this example , because instead of a shrinking supply , we had the supply growing at a lower rate than the growth in demand .
	c:	instead of	[adv prep]	B1	22,23
	c:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	40,41

And because the shift in the demand curve was larger than the one in the supply , we would expect higher wages as a result .
	d:	in demand	[prep noun]	C1	16,21

In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates .
	c:	take off	[verb prep]	A2	12,13

With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .
	c:	in time	[prep noun]	B1	29,30

In the case of the Great Recession , the case for this kind of extra-aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger , but for a smaller recession , given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy , discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution .
	c:	kind of	[noun prep]	B1	12,13

Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice .

In this example so far , bank lending has expanded the money supply by $ 9 million .
	c:	so far	[adv adv]	B1	3,4

It is possible because there are multiple banks in the financial system , they are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits , and loans end up deposited in other banks , which increases deposits and , in essence , the money supply .
	c:	end up	[verb prep]	B1	27,28

Thus , a budget deficit can easily result in an inflow of foreign financial capital , a stronger exchange rate , and a trade deficit .
	c:	exchange rate	[noun noun]	B1	18,19

You can also imagine this appreciation of the exchange rate as being driven by interest rates .
	c:	exchange rate	[noun noun]	B1	8,9

A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital , and appreciate the exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in supply of U. S. dollars .

Fixed costs can take many other forms : for example , the cost of machinery or equipment to produce the product , research and development costs to develop new products , even an expense like advertising to popularize a brand name .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	8,9

The third column shows the fixed costs , which do not change regardless of the level of production .
	c:	regardless of	[adv prep]	C1	12,13

For example , two barbers cost : 2 ?
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

So , for example , with two barbers the total cost is : $ 160 + $ 160 $ 320 .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	2,3

For example , as the number of barbers rises from two to three , the marginal output gain is only 20 ; and as the number rises from three to four , the marginal gain is only 12 .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

A second barber reduces the level of disruption from jumping back and forth between these tasks , and allows a greater division of labor and specialization .
	c:	back and forth	[adv conj adv]	C2	10,11,12

However , as other barbers are added , the advantage of each additional barber is less , since the specialization of labor can only go so far .

At some point , you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in each other?s way .

The breakdown of total costs into fixed and variable costs can provide a basis for other insights as well .
	c:	as well	[adv adv]	A1	17,18

For example , the variable cost of producing 80 haircuts is $ 400 , so the average variable cost is $ 400/80 , or $ 5 per haircut .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	0,1

For example , as quantity produced increases from 40 to 60 haircuts , total costs rise by 400 ?

Breaking down total costs into fixed cost , marginal cost , average total cost , and average variable cost is useful because each statistic offers its own insights for the firm .
	c:	break down	[verb prep]	B1	0,1

However , variable costs can be changed , so they convey information about the firm?s ability to cut costs in the present and the extent to which costs will increase if production rises .

For example , consider firms that rake leaves in the fall or shovel snow off sidewalks and driveways in the winter .

It may seem counterintuitive that marginal revenue could ever be zero or negative : after all , does an increase in quantity sold not always mean more revenue ?
	c:	after all	[prep det]	C1	14,15

For example , at an output of 3 in , marginal revenue is 800 and marginal cost is 400 , so producing this unit will clearly add to overall profits .

Thus , the monopoly can tell from the marginal revenue and marginal cost that of the choices given in the table , the profit-maximizing level of output is 4 .

	c:	a certain	[det adj]	B2	30,31

When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime , for example , the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1	11,12

If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true , then in the national saving and investment identity , any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving .
	c:	in private	[prep adj]	B2	32,33

As a result , changes in government borrowing would have no effect at all on either physical capital investment or trade balances .

However , when budget deficits turn to surpluses in the late 1990s , there is a simultaneous decline in private saving .
	c:	in private	[prep adj]	B2	18,19

When budget deficits get very large in 2008 and 2009 , on the other hand , there is some sign of a rise in saving .

As shown in , in this particular example the substitution effect and income effect on Ogden?s consumption of haircuts are offsetting?so he ends up consuming the same quantity of haircuts after the price increase for pizza as before .
	c:	end up	[verb prep]	B1	22,23
	d:	in particular	[prep adj]	B1	11,21

For example , if Ogden?s substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is especially strong , and outweighs the income effect , then a higher price for pizza might lead to increased consumption of haircuts .
