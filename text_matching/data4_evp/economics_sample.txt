Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity .
	notfound


These can be individual decisions , family decisions , business decisions or societal decisions .
	notfound


If you look around carefully , you will see that scarcity is a fact of life .
	notfound


Scarcity means that human wants for goods , services and resources exceed what is available .
	notfound


Resources , such as labor , tools , land , and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply .
	c:	such as	[adj prep]	A2


Of course , the ultimate scarce resource is time - everyone , rich or poor , has just 24 hours in the day to try to acquire the goods they want .
	c:	of course	[prep noun]	A1
	c:	of course	[prep noun]	A1


At any point in time , there is only a finite amount of resources available .
	c:	in time	[prep noun]	B1


Think about it this way : In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158.6 million workers , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
	notfound


Similarly , the total area of the United States is 3,794,101 square miles .
	notfound


These are large numbers for such crucial resources , however , they are limited .
	notfound


Because these resources are limited , so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them .
	notfound


Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite , and you can see why scarcity is a problem .
	notfound


If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem , consider the following : Does everyone need food to eat ?
	c:	the following	[det noun]	B1


Does everyone need a decent place to live ?
	notfound


Does everyone have access to healthcare ?
	notfound


In every country in the world , there are people who are hungry , homeless -LRB- for example , those who call park benches their beds , as shown in -LSB- link -RSB- -RRB- , and in need of healthcare , just to focus on a few critical goods and services .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1
	c:	a few	[det adj]	A2


Why is this the case ?
	notfound


It is because of scarcity .
	c:	because of	[prep prep]	B1


Let 's delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper , because it is crucial to understanding economics .
	notfound


The Problem of Scarcity Think about all the things you consume : food , shelter , clothing , transportation , healthcare , and entertainment .
	notfound


How do you acquire those items ?
	notfound


You do not produce them yourself .
	notfound


You buy them .
	notfound


How do you afford the things you buy ?
	notfound


You work for pay .
	notfound


Or if you do not , someone else does on your behalf .
	notfound


Yet most of us never have enough to buy all the things we want .
	notfound


This is because of scarcity .
	c:	because of	[prep prep]	B1


So how do we solve it ?
	notfound


Every society , at every level , must make choices about how to use its resources .
	notfound


Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation .
	notfound


Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police and fire protection or into the school system .
	notfound


Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or to protecting the environment .
	c:	the environment	[det noun]	B1


In most cases , there just is n't enough money in the budget to do everything .
	notfound


So why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume ?
	notfound


The simple answer is most of us do not know how , but that is not the main reason .
	notfound


-LRB- When you study economics , you will discover that the obvious choice is not always the right answer-or at least the complete answer .
	c:	at least	[prep adj]	A2
	c:	at least	[prep adj]	A2
	c:	at least	[prep adj]	A2


Studying economics teaches you to think in a different of way . -RRB-
	notfound


Think back to pioneer days , when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today , from building their homes , to growing their crops , to hunting for food , to repairing their equipment .
	c:	to do so	[prep verb adv]	C1


Most of us do not know how to do all-or any-of those things .
	notfound


It is not because we could not learn .
	notfound


Rather , we do not have to .
	notfound


The reason why is something called the division and specialization of labor , a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith , -LSB- link -RSB- , in his book , The Wealth of Nations .
	notfound


The Division of and Specialization of Labor The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith -LRB- 1723 ?
	notfound


1790 -RRB- published his famous book The Wealth of Nations in 1776 .
	notfound


Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way .
	c:	the first	[det adj]	B1


In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person .
	c:	the same	[det adj]	A1
	c:	the same	[det adj]	A1
	c:	the first	[det adj]	B1
	c:	instead of	[adv prep]	B1


To illustrate the division of labor , Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin : drawing out a piece of wire , cutting it to the right length , straightening it , putting a head on one end and a point on the other , and packaging pins for sale , to name just a few .
	c:	how many	[XXXXX adj]	A1
	c:	a few	[det adj]	A2
	c:	for sale	[prep noun]	A2


Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that were often done by different people-all for a pin , believe it or not !
	c:	or not	[conj adv]	A2
	c:	or not	[conj adv]	A2
	c:	believe it or not	[verb perPro conj adv]	B1


Modern businesses divide tasks as well .
	c:	as well	[adv adv]	A1


Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides up the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef , sous chefs , less-skilled kitchen help , servers to wait on the tables , a greeter at the door , janitors to clean up , and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills-not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food , furniture , kitchen equipment , and the building where it is located .
	notfound


A complex business like a large manufacturing factory , such as the shoe factory shown in -LSB- link -RSB- , or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications .
	c:	such as	[adj prep]	A2


Why the Division of Labor Increases Production When the tasks involved with producing a good or service are divided and subdivided , workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output .
	notfound


In his observations of pin factories , Smith observed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day , but that a small business of 10 workers -LRB- some of whom would need to do two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making -RRB- , could make 48,000 pins in a day .
	notfound


How can a group of workers , each specializing in certain tasks , produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves ?
	c:	the same	[det adj]	A1
	c:	the same	[det adj]	A1


Smith offered three reasons .
	notfound


First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage .
	d:	in particular	[prep adj]	B1
			(PP)[(DT)]


-LRB- In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . -RRB-
	notfound


People have different skills , talents , and interests , so they will be better at some jobs than at others .
	notfound


The particular advantages may be based on educational choices , which are in turn shaped by interests and talents .
	c:	in turn	[prep noun]	B2
	c:	in turn	[prep noun]	B2


Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors , for instance .
	c:	for instance	[prep noun]	B1


For some goods , specialization will be affected by geography-it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida , but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota .
	notfound


If you live in or near a big city , it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area .
	c:	movie theater	[noun noun]	A1


Whatever the reason , if people specialize in the production of what they do best , they will be more productive than if they produce a combination of things , some of which they are good at and some of which they are not .
	notfound


Second , workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality .
	notfound


This pattern holds true for many workers , including assembly line laborers who build cars , stylists who cut hair , and doctors who perform heart surgery .
	notfound


In fact , specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better .
	c:	in fact	[prep noun]	B1


A similar pattern often operates within businesses .
	notfound


In many cases , a business that focuses on one or a few products -LRB- sometimes called its `` core competency '' -RRB- is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products .
	c:	a few	[det adj]	A2


Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines .
	notfound


For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each car will be quite expensive to make on average .
	c:	for example	[prep noun]	A1
	c:	on average	[prep noun]	B2


However , if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year , then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks , and the average cost of production per car will be lower .
	notfound


The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents , learn to do their specialized jobs better , and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services .
	c:	as a whole	[prep det noun]	B2


The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity .
	notfound


Trade and Markets Specialization only makes sense , though , if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need .
	notfound


In short , specialization requires trade .
	c:	in short	[prep adj]	C1

	notfound


You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket-you just buy the jacket and wear it .
	notfound


You do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car-you just get in and drive .
	c:	get in	[verb prep]	B1
	c:	get in	[verb prep]	B1
	c:	get in	[verb prep]	B1


Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume , the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want .
	c:	instead of	[adv prep]	B1


This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy .

	notfound


Key Concepts and Summary Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity , which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply .
	notfound


A modern economy displays a division of labor , in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want .
	notfound


The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons : a -RRB- It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels ; b -RRB- It encourages the agents to learn and invent ; c -RRB- It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale .
	c:	due to	[adj prep]	B1


Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets .
