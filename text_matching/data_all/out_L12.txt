	c:	[verb]	appear to be	[verb prep verb]	A2
	c:	[adj]	to be	[prep verb]	A1


First , since theory itself intermingles ideas from philosophy , linguistics , history , political theory , and psychoanalysis , why should theorists worry about whether the texts they 're reading are literary or not ?
	d:	[adj]	about be	[prep verb]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be read	[verb verb]	A1

where you can deal with both literary and nonliterary works .
	c:	[verb]	deal with	[noun prep]	A2
	c:	[noun]	literary work	[adj noun]	B1


You can study Virginia Woolf 's novels or Freud 's case histories or both , and the distinction does n't seem methodologically crucial .
	d:	[verb]	can do	[other verb]	A1
	c:	[noun]	case history	[noun noun]	A1
	d:	[conj]	or not	[conj adv]	A1


It 's not that all texts are somehow equal : some texts are taken to be richer , more powerful , more exemplary , more contestatory , more central , for one reason or another .
	d:	[adv]	all more	[det adj]	B1
	d:	[noun]	all powerful	[det noun]	A2
	d:	[verb]	be all for	[verb det prep]	A1

	d:	[verb]	work in	[noun prep]	A1

Second , the distinction has not seemed central because works of theory have discovered what is most simply called the ' literariness ' of non-literary phenomena .
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1

For instance , discussions of the nature of historical understanding have taken as a model what is involved in understanding a story .

Characteristically , historians do not produce explanations that are like the predictive explanations of science : they can not show that when X and Y occur , Z will necessarily happen .

What they do , rather , is to show how one thing led to another , how the First World War came to break out , not why it had to happen .
	d:	[verb]	be come	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be show	[verb verb]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be to	[verb prep]	A1

	d:	[noun]	what happen	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what be	[other verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what be happen	[other verb verb]	A1


The model for historical explanation is thus the logic of stories : the way a story shows how something came to happen , connecting the initial situation , the development , and the outcome in a way that makes sense .
	d:	[conj]	and that	[conj prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be come	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be connect	[verb verb]	B1

	d:	[verb]	be to	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	come in	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	come to	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[noun]	for show	[prep noun]	A2
	d:	[adv]	for that	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[adv]	in a sense	[prep det noun]	A2

	d:	[verb]	show in	[noun prep]	A2
	d:	[verb]	show way	[noun noun]	A2
	d:	[noun]	way in	[noun prep]	A1


The model for historical intelligibility , in short , is literary narrative .
	c:	[adv]	in short	[prep adj]	A1


We who hear and read stories are good at telling whether a plot makes sense , hangs together , or whether the story remains unfinished .
	d:	[verb]	be at	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be good	[verb adj]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be make	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be tell	[verb verb]	A1

	d:	[verb]	hear tell	[verb verb]	A1
	c:	[verb]	make sense	[verb noun]	A2
	d:	[verb]	tell a story	[verb det noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	tell story	[verb noun]	A1
	d:	[noun]	we a	[perPro det]	A1


If the same models of what makes sense and what counts as a story characterize both literary and historical narratives , then distinguishing between them need not seem an urgent theoretical matter .
	c:	[verb]	distinguish between	[verb prep]	B1
	d:	[prep]	if not	[prep adv]	A1
	c:	[verb]	make sense	[verb noun]	A2
	d:	[adj]	same as	[adj prep]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what what	[det det]	A1


Similarly , theorists have come to insist on the importance in non-literary texts ?
	d:	[verb]	come in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	come on	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	come to	[verb prep]	A1

	d:	[verb]	have on	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	have to	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	insist on	[verb prep]	B1


whether Freud 's accounts of his psychoanalytic cases or works of philosophical argument?of rhetorical devices such as metaphor , which have been thought crucial to literature but have often been considered purely ornamental in other sorts of discourses .
	d:	[adj]	as be	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[prep]	as to	[prep prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1

	d:	[noun]	think in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	think to	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	work in	[noun prep]	A1


In showing how rhetorical figures shape thought in other discourses as well , theorists demonstrate a powerful literariness at work in supposedly non-literary texts , thus complicating the distinction between the literary and the non-literary .
	c:	[adv]	as well	[adv adv]	A2
	c:	[adj]	at work	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	figure in	[noun prep]	A2

	d:	[verb]	show in	[noun prep]	A2
	d:	[verb]	think as	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[noun]	think in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adj]	well in	[adv prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	work in	[noun prep]	A1


But the fact that I describe this situation by speaking of the discovery of the ` literariness ' of non-literary phenomena indicates that the notion of literature continues to play a role and needs to be addressed .
	d:	[prep]	by of	[prep prep]	A1
	d:	[noun]	by play	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[adv]	by the	[prep det]	A1

Now people might ask this question because they were wondering how to decide which books are literature and which are not , but it is more likely that they already have an idea what counts as literature and want to know something else : are there any essential , distinguishing features that literary works share ?
