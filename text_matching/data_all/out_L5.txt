Among the ITS that are already available or being developed are : in-vehicle navigation systems that tell a driver 's location , directions to a destination , alternate routes , location of congestion or accidents , when to turn at intersections , names of upcoming streets , and more E adaptive cruise control , where sensors detect the distance to the vehicle ahead and adjust speed so as to create a safe following distance E '' smart signs '' project on the windscreen containing information warning of hazards -LRB- e.g. , railroad crossing -RRB- or regulations -LRB- e.g. , speed limit change -RRB- ; these could replace or supplement existing roadside signs E collision warning systems , which let drivers know when they are closing in too fast on a fixed object or another vehicle -LRB- to prevent rear-end collisions , side swipe , and run-off-road accidents -RRB- E crash avoidance systems that actually take control of the vehicle if a collision is otherwise inevitable E vision enhancement systems -LRB- VES -RRB- that detect hazards such as pedestrians and animals on the road at night , allowing the driver to detect hazards that might otherwise be detected too late or not at all ; other VES include ultraviolet headlights which reflect more light back from special pavement markings and hazards -LRB- bridge abutments -RRB- at night E headlights that shine around curves as vehicles begin to turn , allowing vision farther ahead on curves E information of interest to tourists -LRB- accommodation , fuel , food , and so forth -RRB- which now appears mainly on signs communication devices such as phones , e-mail , and fax machines additional vehicle systems monitoring , some of which may not be necessary -LRB- e.g. , outside temperature -RRB- emergency alerting systems meant to provide to a dispatch center emergency information about breakdowns , accidents , and other events that require assistance -LRB- e.g. , ambulance , tow truck -RRB- ; such alerting devices give an increased sense of security to drivers .
