For example , female lionesses which suckled young cubs belonging to other females in their pride were assumed to be doing so in order to make sure that there were plenty of lions in the next generation and so the species would n't become extinct .

This must obviously be the case if natural selection is to operate in the way Darwin envisaged : since the whole process is based on the notion of interindividual competition , any organism that behaves so as to benefit the species or group at some cost to its own reproductive interests is likely to leave fewer descendants than less noble-spirited individuals who just look after themselves .

This is sometimes known as the Principle of Evolution .

By specifying a mechanism by which evolutionary change could be effected , it then became possible to formulate testable hypotheses aimed at explaining the anatomy and behaviour of organisms .

If a trait was an adaptation , then it should show evidence of being well adapted to the purpose it was supposed to serve ; and if it continued to confer a selective advantage on the organism that possessed it , then it should also help to increase the survival and reproductive success of those organisms relative to those that did not possess it -LRB- or which possessed inferior versions of it -RRB- .

A second important consequence of Darwin 's position was that it made ' group selection ' -LRB- evolution for the benefit of the species -RRB- an extremely unlikely -LRB- though not entirely impossible -RRB- explanation for the evolution of anything .
	d:	[verb]	be for	[verb prep]	A1

	d:	[pron]	not anything	[adv noun]	A1
	c:	[adv]	not entirely	[adv adv]	B1
	c:	[adj]	that it	[prep perPro]	A1


Despite this , group selection remained firmly ensconced in the public imagination .
	d:	[adv]	in public	[prep noun]	A2
	c:	[noun]	the public	[det noun]	A2


Indeed , even biologists often failed to appreciate this point and it was not until the 1960s that the concept of group selection was finally laid to rest .

Evolutionary biologists have remained extremely cautious of mentioning group selection ever since .
