Metaphor is for most people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish?a matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language .
	d:	[verb]	be a matter of	[verb det noun prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be for	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be matter of	[verb noun prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[noun]	for most	[prep adj]	A2
	c:	[adv]	rather than	[adv prep]	A2


Moreover , metaphor is typically viewed as characteristic of language alone , a matter of words rather than thought or action .
	d:	[verb]	be a matter of	[verb det noun prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be action	[verb noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be characteristic of	[verb adj prep]	B2
	d:	[verb]	be matter of	[verb noun prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[adv]	rather than	[adv prep]	A2


For this reason , most people think they can get along perfectly well without metaphor .
	d:	[noun]	for most	[prep adj]	A2
	d:	[adv]	for reason	[prep noun]	A1
	c:	[adv]	for this reason	[prep det noun]	A1
	c:	[verb]	get along	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	get along well	[verb adv adv]	A1
	d:	[verb]	get well	[verb adv]	A1
	d:	[adj]	most get	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[adj]	most think	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[adj]	most without	[adv prep]	A2


We have found , on the contrary , that metaphor is pervasive in everyday life , not just in language but in thought and action .
	d:	[verb]	be action	[verb noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be in action	[verb prep noun]	A1
	d:	[prep]	find in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	find on	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	have be	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[verb]	have in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	have life	[verb noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	have on	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[noun]	have not	[verb adv]	A1
	d:	[noun]	in action	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	life in	[noun prep]	A1
	d:	[adv]	on contrary	[prep noun]	B1
	c:	[adv]	on the contrary	[prep det noun]	B1
	d:	[adv]	on that	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[adv]	that be	[det verb]	A1
	c:	[prep]	the contrary	[det noun]	B1
	d:	[interj]	that life	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[interj]	that be life	[det verb noun]	A1


Our ordinary conceptual system , in terms of which we both think and act , is fundamentally metaphorical in nature .
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adv]	in which	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[noun]	think in	[verb prep]	A1


The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect .
	d:	[verb]	be matter of	[verb noun prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adv]	that be	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[verb]	thought of	[noun prep]	A2


They also govern our everyday functioning , down to the most mundane details .
	c:	[prep]	down to	[adv prep]	A1
	c:	[noun]	the most	[det adv]	A2


Our concepts structure what we perceive , how we get around in the world , and how we relate to other people .
	d:	[adj]	and other	[conj noun]	A2
	c:	[verb]	get around	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	get in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	get in to	[verb prep prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	get to	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[prep]	in to	[prep prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	relate to	[verb prep]	B1
	d:	[noun]	the people	[det noun]	A1


Our conceptual system thus plays a central role in defining our everyday realities .
	d:	[adj]	in reality	[prep noun]	B1
	d:	[verb]	play a role	[verb det noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	play role	[verb noun]	A1
	d:	[noun]	we a	[perPro det]	A1


If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical , then the way we think , what we experience , and what we do every day is very much a matter of metaphor .
	d:	[verb]	be a matter of	[verb det noun prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be matter of	[verb noun prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be right	[verb adj]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be think	[verb verb]	A1
	c:	[adv]	every day	[det noun]	A1
	d:	[noun]	in experience	[prep noun]	A2
	d:	[adv]	in matter	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[prep]	in matter of	[prep noun prep]	A1
	d:	[conjuction]	in that	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[adv]	in that matter	[prep det noun]	A1
	d:	[prep]	in the matter of	[prep det noun prep]	A1
	d:	[adj]	in the way	[prep det noun]	A1
	d:	[adv]	in way	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[adj]	right think	[adv verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	right way	[adj noun]	A1
	d:	[adv]	that be	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[verb]	think of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adj]	that be be	[det verb verb]	A1
	c:	[noun]	very much	[adv noun]	A1
	d:	[noun]	we a	[perPro det]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what what	[det det]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what do	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what be	[other verb]	A1


But our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of .
	c:	[adj]	aware of	[adj prep]	B1
	d:	[verb]	be aware	[verb adj]	B1
	d:	[verb]	be aware of	[verb adj prep]	B1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be something	[verb noun]	A1


In most of the little things we do every day , we simply think and act more or less automatically along certain lines .
	c:	[adv]	every day	[det noun]	A1
	c:	[adv]	in line	[prep noun]	A1
	c:	[adj]	in most	[prep adj]	A2
	d:	[noun]	in thing	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[adv]	more less	[adv adj]	B1
	c:	[adv]	more or less	[adv conj adv]	B1
	d:	[adj]	most act	[adv verb]	B1
	d:	[adj]	most think	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[noun]	the thing	[det noun]	A1
	d:	[noun]	the line	[det noun]	A1
	d:	[noun]	thing do	[noun verb]	A1


Just what these lines are is by no means obvious .
	d:	[verb]	be means	[verb noun]	B2
	d:	[adv]	by means	[prep noun]	B2
	c:	[adv]	by no means	[prep det noun]	B2
	d:	[noun]	what be	[other verb]	A1


One way to find out is by looking at language .
	d:	[verb]	be at	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	find out	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	look at	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[adj]	one way	[adj noun]	A1
	d:	[noun]	out look	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[adj]	to be	[prep verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	way out	[noun prep]	A1
	d:	[noun]	way look	[noun verb]	A1


Since communication is based on the same conceptual system that we use in thinking and acting , language is an important source of evidence for what that system is like .
	d:	[verb]	act for	[noun prep]	A2
	d:	[verb]	act like	[verb prep]	B1
	d:	[adj]	and like	[conj prep]	A1
	d:	[conj]	and that	[conj prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be a source of	[verb det noun prep]	A2
	c:	[verb]	be base	[verb verb]	B1
	c:	[verb]	be base on	[verb verb prep]	B1
	d:	[verb]	be for	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be important	[verb adj]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be like	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be on	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be same	[verb adj]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be source of	[verb noun prep]	A2
	d:	[verb]	be the same	[verb det adj]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be use	[verb noun]	A2
	c:	[verb]	base on	[noun prep]	A2
	d:	[verb]	be think	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	be evidence	[verb noun]	A2
	d:	[noun]	be in evidence	[verb prep noun]	A2
	d:	[adv]	for that	[prep det]	A1
	c:	[adv]	for what	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[conj]	in act of	[prep noun prep]	A2
	d:	[adj]	in evidence	[prep noun]	A2
	d:	[conjuction]	in that	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[adv]	on that	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[adv]	on what	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[adv]	that be	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[pron]	the like	[det adj]	B1
	d:	[noun]	the system	[det noun]	A2
	d:	[verb]	think of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adj]	that be be	[det verb verb]	A1
	d:	[adv]	use be	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	we a	[perPro det]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what be	[other verb]	A1


Primarily on the basis of linguistic evidence , we have found that most of our ordinary conceptual system is metaphorical in nature .
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[prep]	find in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	have be	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[verb]	have in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adv]	on that	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[adv]	that be	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	the most	[det adv]	A2
	d:	[noun]	the system	[det noun]	A2


And we have found a way to begin to identify in detail just what the metaphors are that structure how we perceive , how we think , and what we do .
	d:	[conj]	and that	[conj prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be think	[verb verb]	A1
	c:	[verb]	find a way	[verb det noun]	A1

	c:	[adv]	in detail	[prep noun]	A2
	d:	[conjuction]	in that	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[adj]	just do	[adv verb]	A1
	c:	[adj]	to be	[prep verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	to do	[prep verb]	A1

	d:	[noun]	way in	[noun prep]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what do	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what be do	[other verb verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what be	[other verb]	A1


To give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such a concept to structure an everyday activity , let us start with the concept ARGUMENT and the conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR .
	d:	[verb]	be for	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be to	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be with	[verb prep]	A1

	d:	[noun]	what it be	[other perPro verb]	A1


This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety of expressions : ARGUMENT IS WAR Your claims are indefensible .
	c:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[prep]	by of	[prep prep]	A1

	d:	[verb]	be about	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be important	[verb adj]	A1

	d:	[noun]	a line	[det noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	can it	[other perPro]	A1
	d:	[noun]	we a	[perPro det]	A1


Many of the things we do in arguing are partially structured by the concept of war .
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[prep]	by of	[prep prep]	A1
	c:	[adv]	by the	[prep det]	A1

	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be there	[verb XXXXX]	A1


reflects this .
	notfound


It is in this sense that the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor is one that we live by in this culture ; it structures the actions we perform in arguing .
	d:	[verb]	be action	[verb noun]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be in action	[verb prep noun]	A1
	d:	[adv]	by the	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[noun]	in action	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[adv]	in sense	[prep noun]	A2
	d:	[conjuction]	in that	[prep det]	A1
	c:	[adv]	in this	[prep det]	A1
	c:	[verb]	live by	[adj prep]	B1
	d:	[verb]	live in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adv]	that be	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[adj]	that be be	[det verb verb]	A1
	d:	[adj]	that it	[prep perPro]	A1
	d:	[pron]	that one	[prep adj]	A1
	d:	[adj]	that be it	[det verb perPro]	A1
	d:	[pron]	this one	[det adj]	A1
	d:	[noun]	this that	[det det]	A1


Try to imagine a culture where arguments are not viewed in terms of war , where no one wins or loses , where there is no sense of attacking or defending , gaining or losing ground .
	d:	[adj]	a one	[det adj]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be lose	[verb verb]	A2
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be one of	[verb adj prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be there	[verb XXXXX]	A1
	d:	[verb]	gain ground	[noun noun]	B1
	d:	[adv]	in sense	[prep noun]	A2
	d:	[adv]	in there	[prep XXXXX]	A1
	c:	[verb]	lose ground	[verb noun]	A2
	d:	[noun]	lose lose	[verb verb]	A2
	d:	[noun]	no no	[det det]	A1
	c:	[pron]	no one	[det noun]	A2
	d:	[adj]	no win	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[adj]	not lose	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[pron]	not one	[adv adj]	A1
	d:	[adj]	not there	[adv adv]	A1
	d:	[adj]	to be	[prep verb]	A1


Imagine a culture where an argument is viewed as a dance , the participants are seen as performers , and the goal is to perform in a balanced and aesthetically pleasing way .
	c:	[adj]	aesthetically please	[adv verb]	unknown
	d:	[adj]	as be	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[adv]	as please	[prep verb]	B1
	d:	[prep]	as to	[prep prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be a participant	[verb det noun]	B1
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be participant	[verb noun]	B1
	c:	[verb]	be to	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be please	[verb verb]	B1
	c:	[adj]	be see	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[adv]	in way	[prep noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	see to	[verb prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	see as	[verb prep]	A1


In such a culture , people would view arguments differently , experience them differently , carry them out differently , and talk about them differently .
	d:	[noun]	a people	[det noun]	A1
	d:	[verb]	carry about	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	carry out	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adv]	in differently	[prep adv]	A2
	d:	[noun]	in experience	[prep noun]	A2
	d:	[adv]	in out	[prep adv]	A1
	d:	[adj]	in view	[prep noun]	A2
	c:	[verb]	talk about	[noun prep]	B1


But we would probably not view them as arguing at all : they would simply be doing something different .
	d:	[adj]	as be	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[conj]	as would be	[adv other verb]	A2
	c:	[noun]	at all	[prep det]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be something	[verb noun]	A1
	d:	[adv]	not at all	[adv prep det]	A1
	d:	[adj]	not do	[adv verb]	A1
	d:	[adv]	not all	[adv det]	A1
	d:	[adj]	would be	[other verb]	A1


It would seem strange even to call what they were doing `` arguing . ''
	d:	[adv]	it seem	[perPro verb]	A2
	c:	[adv]	it would seem	[perPro other verb]	A2
	d:	[adj]	to be	[prep verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	to do	[prep verb]	A1
	d:	[adj]	would be	[other verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what do	[det verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what be do	[other verb verb]	A1
	d:	[noun]	what be	[other verb]	A1


Perhaps the most neutral way of describing this difference between their culture and ours would be to say that we have a discourse form structured in terms of battle and they have one structured in terms of dance .
	d:	[adj]	a one	[det adj]	A1
	d:	[conj]	and that	[conj prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be of	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[verb]	be one of	[verb adj prep]	A1
	c:	[verb]	be to	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adj]	be have	[verb verb]	A1
	d:	[adv]	between we	[prep perPro]	A1
	d:	[verb]	have in	[verb prep]	A1
	d:	[adj]	most structure	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[adj]	most battle	[adv verb]	B1
	d:	[adj]	most between	[adv prep]	A2
	d:	[adj]	most describe	[adv verb]	A2

	d:	[adj]	most say	[adv verb]	A2
	d:	[adj]	most term	[adv verb]	B1
	d:	[adj]	most way	[adv noun]	A2
	d:	[adv]	of this	[prep det]	A1
